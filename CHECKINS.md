Make sure that your TA has had a chance to sign off on your check-in each week (before the deadline); typically you should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.


## Check-in 1

#### Brief Description

###### High Level Purpose

The high-level purpose of our DSL is to provide non-programmers with the ability to make and maintain their own blog website. Aiming for users that are not accustomed to programming or prefer a simplistic mode of blogging on the internet. It will allow users to start, edit and update different posts on the blog page.

###### Rich Features

One main feature of this DSL would be to add and edit blog posts, allowing users to edit in any text as well as which category that post would belong to.

A user can have if conditions in this DSL and render certain blogs based on these conditions. Render certain blogs based on the time of day, or even use it to convert the blog to dark mode.

Another main feature that will enhance user's experience with our blog-service is allowing the users to loop through blog posts, whether it be all posts or posts from a certain category, and customize a certain feature regarding that post, such as the text size, light/dark mode. 

**Functions:** User can define functions in our DSL that allow you to quickly create new blogs with less duplicate code. 

**Array:** Users can add, remove (possibly sort) blog posts from an array. This array could represent the blog posts currently being shown on the screen.

**Variables:** Users can store blog posts in variables so they can be stored and referenced in later code (perhaps inside a future conditional statment).

**Conditionals:** Users can perform actions conditionally (e.g. reassign blog post variable, add and remove from displayed blog post array).

Features: functions, array (with adding and removing), variables to store blogs, conditionals

#### TA Changes/Feedback

TA recommended to use conditionals in order to add more functionality (display blog depending on time of day)

Further developping features with more specificity.
